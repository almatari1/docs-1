#### Frequency
* Parameterise the value to set the frequency - we need to be able to determine the best setting for this and will probably "play" around with different values to assess the correct value

#### Storage
* Save the frequency value in the configuration file for the moment. At a later stage we could, if required, create a table for metadata or similiar value types.

#### Threading
* Run this process in its own thread
